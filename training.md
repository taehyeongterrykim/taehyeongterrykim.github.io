<p>
  Iâ€™m interested in quantitative research methods and computational approaches to corpus linguistics. I use these skills to produce linguistically interpretable analyses of corpus data. In particular, I specialize in <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> for data processing and analysis, with experience in:<br><br>
  <strong>Data processing:</strong> corpus building, web scraping, text cleaning, tokenization, sentence splitting, lemmatization, POS tagging<br>
  <strong>Feature extraction:</strong> n-grams, p-frames, keywords &amp; keyness, concordances, grammatical features<br>
  <strong>Statistical modeling:</strong> LMMs, GLMMs, SEMs, parametric/nonparametric bootstrapping
