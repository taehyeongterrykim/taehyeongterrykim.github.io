Hi, I am Taehyeong Kim (Terry Kim), a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Linguistics at Northern Arizona University (NAU). I have an M.A. in English Language Education from Seoul National University, and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Yonsei University. 

My research interests include quantitative research methods and corpus linguistics, specifically in relation to how these are applied to topics pertaining to second language acquisition, linguistic complexity, and register variation. I am interested in advancing our understanding of second language production, while using methods that are linguistically interpretable and well motivated theoretically and functionally.
