I am a Ph.D.  student in Applied Linguistics at Northern Arizona University. I received an M.A. in English Language Education from Seoul National University, and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Yonsei University, Korea. 

My research interests include quantitative research methods and corpus linguistics in relation to second language acquisition, linguistic complexity, and register variation. I am interested in advancing our understanding of second language production, grounded in linguistically interpretable account of language and motivated by a theoretical and functional basis. I am also interested in contributing to methodological advancements in the field, advances driven by a sound methodological understanding and decision-making.
